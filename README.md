<p dir = "auto">
    This Community Management System is designed to assist local governments, non-profits, and community organizations in efficiently managing and tracking the involvement of community members across a range of programs. By centralizing data on member participation, volunteer hours, and engagement in sustainability initiatives, the system aims to foster greater community involvement and accountability. The system allows for easy access to data such as attendance at events, roles in volunteer programs, and contributions to sustainability projects, empowering organizations to make informed decisions, recognize dedicated individuals, and allocate resources more effectively for community growth and engagement.

</div>
<ul dir = "auto">
  <li>☕OOP Concepts - Community Member Management System class defines specific behaviors, such as adding, deleting, or updating member records. Encapsulating or grouping these methods with the data they operate on, helps to isolate functionality and makes the code modular and reusable. </li>
  <li>💡Tkinter Library for GUI - Buttons, labels, and text fields were utilized to create an interactive user interface. Used to create input forms for adding or updating member details, buttons for commands like search, delete, and displays for member information.</li>
  <li>🗃️ MySQL Database - Program interacts with a database to store and retrieve member data. Python's sqlite3 or mysql.connector libraries allow connection to databases, enabling data storage beyond the program's runtime. SQL commands like insert, select, update, and delete manage the records efficiently.</li>
  <li>⏰ Time - Used to provide accurate date and time information.</li>
  <li>🌈 Themes - Used themes form Tkinter Library to make it more aesthetic. </li>
